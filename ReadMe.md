                What does summSubb do:  summSub will aggregate all subnets found within any files found within the");
                provided input directory and summarize them.  For example if a file contains:");
                Console.WriteLine();
                192.168.2.0/24");
                192.168.3.0/24");
                Console.WriteLine();
                Then summSub will output a file called 'summarizedSubnets.txt' that contains a single entry:");
                Console.WriteLine();
                192.168.2.0/23");
                Console.WriteLine();
                The new subnet can then be used for both security and routing decisions");

                Console.WriteLine();
                Notes:  summSubb will parse all files in the input directory with a file name that includes the phrase 'ipranges'");
